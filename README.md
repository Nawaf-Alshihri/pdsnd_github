Post your Work on GitHub

### Description
In this project, I've created a GitHub repository and a local repository. I've worked on a repo for my BikeShare project, making multiple branches, making edits to files on those branches (e.g., a readme file and my Python code), and then i've committed the changes to my remote repository.
